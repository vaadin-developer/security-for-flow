/**
 * JS-SEC-036 (CWE-770): sends a token-endpoint request and reads the response body
 * bounded to {@link #MAX_BODY_BYTES}. The token-propagation strategies previously used
 * {@code BodyHandlers.ofString()}, which buffers the whole response into memory before
 * any inspection — a compromised/misbehaving OP token endpoint (or a TLS-terminating
 * proxy) could return a multi-gigabyte body and OOM the resource server. This reads via
 * {@code ofInputStream()} + {@code readNBytes(MAX + 1)} and rejects an oversized body
 * before it is fully materialized, matching the 1 MiB ceiling used by every other
 * OIDC/OAuth2 HTTP client. The returned {@link Response} mirrors {@code HttpResponse}'s
 * {@code statusCode()} / {@code body()} accessors so callers stay unchanged.
