/**
 * Persistent event store for sliding-window rate-limiting policies
 * (V00.70 Phase 7c).
 * <p>
 * The store is intentionally <em>event-based</em> rather than a
 * counter + window-start pair: a {@link RateLimitStore} records one
 * timestamp per event, and the policy decides how to interpret that
 * stream — a fixed window, a sliding window, a leaky bucket, or a
 * token bucket are all expressible on top of the same primitives.
 *
 * <p>Lifecycle:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #recordEvent(RateLimitKey, Instant)} appends one
 *       timestamp.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #countSince(RateLimitKey, Instant)} returns how many
 *       events the key holds at or after the cutoff — the policy
 *       picks {@code cutoff = now - window}.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #reset(RateLimitKey)} drops everything under a key
 *       (typically called on a successful authentication that
 *       cancels the throttle).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #purgeOlderThan(Instant)} is the retention sweep —
 *       runs on a schedule, drops events the policy would no longer
 *       count anyway.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Implementations must be thread-safe; concurrent recordEvent
 * and countSince happen on every protected endpoint.
