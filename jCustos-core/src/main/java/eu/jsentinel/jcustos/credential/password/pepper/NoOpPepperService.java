/**
 * Phase-1a placeholder for {@link PepperService}.
 *
 * <p>This implementation deliberately performs no pepper protection. It
 * publishes no active key id, and a lookup of any non-empty
 * {@code keyId} resolves to {@link Optional#empty()}. The verification
 * pipeline interprets that as
 * {@code VERIFICATION_FAILED_UNKNOWN_PEPPER_KEY} so an envelope that
 * was peppered cannot be silently downgraded.</p>
 *
 * <p>The class name is the explicit warning: production deployments
 * must replace this implementation when Phase 2 ships a real pepper
 * service.</p>
