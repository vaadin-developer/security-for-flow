/**
 * Immutable, self-consistent view of the current signing key (R00): the
 * {@code keyId} stamped onto an envelope plus the algorithm and private key the
 * envelope is signed with, captured together at one point in time. The publish
 * pipeline takes exactly one snapshot per publish and uses it for both the
 * {@code keyId} stamp and the signing operation, so a concurrent key rotation
 * between those two steps can never produce an envelope stamped with one key id
 * but signed with another key's private material.
 *
 * @param keyId the id of the signing key, stamped onto the envelope
 * @param algorithm the signature algorithm bound to the key
 * @param privateKey the private signing key matching {@code keyId}
