/**
 * Envelope store (Konzept §726) for resume, diagnostics and operational
 * processing. <strong>Not</strong> an audit store — revision-grade persistence
 * is an audit listener's job (Konzept §720).
 *
 * <p>The store guarantees a stable append order so the SSE bridge can resume
 * from a {@link JCustosEventCursor}.
 *
 * <p><strong>Retention (R07, V00.76.10): unbounded by design.</strong> A
 * {@link JCustosEventCursor} is a stable append position, and {@link
 * #findAfter(JCustosEventCursor, int)} resumes from it — so the store is an
 * append-only log and cannot purge old entries without invalidating outstanding
 * cursors. Bounding it is therefore an <em>operational</em> concern: tier the
 * persistent store behind an external retention/archival job (it is "not an
 * audit store" — see above; audit-grade durability is an audit listener's job),
 * or front it with a bounded-window implementation that advances cursors. The
 * shipped in-memory store is for development / single-process use and grows with
 * the event volume; do not use it as a long-lived sink.
