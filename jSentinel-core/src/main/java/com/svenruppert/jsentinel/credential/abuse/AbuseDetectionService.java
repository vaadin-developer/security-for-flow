 * Multi-dimensional abuse detection contract.

 * <h2>Two-call flow</h2>
 * <p>Callers ask {@link #evaluate} <em>before</em> performing the
 * credential operation. The decision says whether the call may
 * proceed, must wait, must hit a step-up check, or must be blocked.
 * After the credential operation completes (success or failure), the
 * caller hands the outcome back through {@link #recordOutcome} so the
 * counters update.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Cluster note</h2>
 * <p>The in-memory reference implementation
 * ({@link InMemoryAbuseDetectionService}) keeps state on the JVM heap
 * — multi-node deployments must replace it with a clustered store
 * (Redis, Hazelcast, Postgres) so a coordinated attack cannot dodge
 * the limits by hopping nodes. The Konzept §13 calls this out as a
 * production requirement.</p>
 *
 * <h2>No leak</h2>
 * <p>Decisions stay generic; exact counters and per-dimension
 * specifics never reach the perimeter (CWE-203 / CWE-307).</p>
